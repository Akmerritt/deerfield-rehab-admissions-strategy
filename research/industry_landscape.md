# Industry Research: Addiction treatment centers in the US

**Objective:** To understand the standard patient journey and market friction points within the addiction and rehabilitation treatment industry in the US.

### 1. How are these centers typically regionally distributed?
*   **Skewed with hubs and deserts:** There is a large concentration of facilitaties in coastal climates (Southern California, South Florida, Arizona) driven by a "destination model" where patients travel for care. This has led to fierce competition and high marketing costs.
*   **Deserts:** Midwest and rural South have severe bed shortages relative to overdose rates.

### 2. What are the different levels of care these facilities provide??
*   **Medical stabilization:** 3-7 days. Patients often complete detox then leave AMA before starting rehab.
*   **Rehab (residential/inpatient):** Core 30-90 day program.
*   **IOP/PHP (outpatient):** Intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization. Patients live at home (or in sober living) and come in for treatment during the day. Many centers lose revenue because they fail to "step down" patients from residential to outpatient effectively. 

### 3. What does the intake process look like and is it standardized? 
*   **Time-intensive:** Industry data suggests a 72-hour window of willingness. If a patient is not admitted within 72 hours of the first call, they likely won't come at all. 
*   **Inquiry:** A patient or family member calls in distress. Friction: Missed calls or "leave a voicemail" systems.
*   **Pre-screening:** Staff ask 20+ questions about drug use history, medical issues, and mental health. Friction: Often done on paper or disparate systems; reptitive for the patient.
*   **Insurance verification:** Staff manually calls the insurance company or usesa portal to check "Verification of Benefits." Friction: This can take hours or days (especially on weekends). **This is the #1 cause of lost admissions.**    
*   **Clinical review:** A doctor/nursereviews the file to ensure the patient is medically appropriate.
*   **Logistics and admission:** Arranging transportation and assigning a bed. 
   
### 4. What are the bottlenecks at each ofthe core conversion phases across the end-to-end patient journey?
*   **Inquiry:** Call centers are overwhelmed and understaffed. If a human doesn't answer immediately, the caller calls the next center.
*   **Verification:** Insurance verification can take up to 24 hours for approval, during which time the patient can change their mind.
*   **Logistics:** The period between saying "yes" and physically arriving at the door. Fear or withdrawal can set in, and patients can change their mind.
*   **Completion:** ~40-50% ofpatients do not complete their full course of treatment. This leads to lost revenue and poor clinical outcomes.
