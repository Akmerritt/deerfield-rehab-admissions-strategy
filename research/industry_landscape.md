# Industry Research: Addiction treatment centers in the US

**Objective:** To understand the standard patient journey and market friction points within the addiction and rehabilitation treatment industry in the US.

### 1. How are these centers typically regionally distributed?
*   **Skewed with hubs and deserts:** There is a large concentration of facilitaties in coastal climates (Southern California, South Florida, Arizona) driven by a "destination model" where patients travel for care. This has led to fierce competition and high marketing costs.
*   **Deserts:** Midwest and rural South have severe bed shortages relative to overdose rates.

### 2. What are the different levels of care these facilities provide??
*   **Medical stabilization:** 3-7 days. Patients often complete detox then leave AMA before starting rehab.
*   **Rehab (residential/inpatient):** Core 30-90 day program.
*   **IOP/PHP (outpatient):** Intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization. Patients live at home (or in sober living) and come in for treatment during the day. Many centers lose revenue because they fail to "step down" patients from residential to outpatient effectively. 

### 3. What does the intake process look like and is it standardized? 
*   **Time-intensive:** Industry data suggests a 72-hour window of willingness. If a patient is not admitted within 72 hours of the first call, they likely won't come at all. 
*   **Inquiry:** A patient or family member calls in distress. Friction: Missed calls or "leave a voicemail" systems.
*   **Pre-screening:** Staff ask 20+ questions about drug use history, medical issues, and mental health. Friction: Often done on paper or disparate systems; reptitive for the patient.
*   **Insurance verification:** Staff manually calls the insurance company or usesa portal to check "Verification of Benefits." Friction: This can take hours or days (especially on weekends). **This is the #1 cause of lost admissions.**    
*   **Clinical review:** A doctor/nursereviews the file to ensure the patient is medically appropriate.
*   **Logistics and admission:** Arranging transportation and assigning a bed. 
   
### 4. What are the bottlenecks at each ofthe core conversion phases across the end-to-end patient journey?
*   **Inquiry:** Call centers are overwhelmed and understaffed. If a human doesn't answer immediately, the caller calls the next center.
*   **Verification:** Insurance verification can take up to 24 hours for approval, during which time the patient can change their mind.
*   **Logistics:** The period between saying "yes" and physically arriving at the door. Fear or withdrawal can set in, and patients can change their mind.
*   **Completion:** ~40-50% ofpatients do not complete their full course of treatment. This leads to lost revenue and poor clinical outcomes.

### 5. What are the demographics and variation in the population who needs, gets admitted to, and gets treated in addiction treatment centers in the US?
*   **Population:** 48 million Americans (age 12+). Y
*   **Age:** Young adults (18-25) have the highest rate of substance use disorders (27%) but are less likely to feel they need treatment compared to older adults.
*   **Gender:** Men more than women (20.7% vs. 13.8%)
*   **Race and ethnicity:** Native American / Alaska Native have the highlest prevalence of SUDs. White populations have higher opioid misuse. Overdose rates are rising fastest among Black men.    

### 6. Who gets admitted?
*   **Treatment gap:** Only 6% to 9% of peoplewho need treatment receive it. THe population that makes it through the door of a treatment center looks different from the general population.
*   **Non-voluntary submissison:** Large percentage of patients are mandated to treatment by courts. These patients have higher retention rates than voluntary patients.
*   **Social services:** Women are more likelyto be referred bysocial services.
*   **Insurance as a gatekeeper:** Private treatment centers are predominantly filled by those withprivate insurance or the ability to pay out-of-pocket. Publicly funded centers serve a population with higher rates of unemployement and homelessness.

### 7. Who is most likely to complete treatment?
*   **Primary substance:** Patients treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder have the highest competion rates (57%). Patients treated for heroin/opioid use disorder have the lowest (30%).
*   **Demographics:** Patients over 26 are more likely to complete treatment than those 18-25. Higher educational attainment and full-time employemnt are strong predictors of completion.
*   **Treatment type:** Patients who receive medications like suboxone or methadone for opioid/alcohol disorders are ~40% more likely to complete treatment than those who relyon therapy alone.

### 8. What are barriers to access for public vs. private facilities?
*   **Private:** Key barriers are cost ($20-$60k/month), strict insurance limits.
*   **Public:** Key barriers are bed availability, and high caseloands mean less indivudla therapy and more reliance on group sessions.
*   **Rural areas:** Rural residents have higher rates of alcohol and methamphetamine use, but fwer options. They often need to travel 50+ miles to the nearest treatment center.
*   **Treatment gaps:** Buprenorphine can be prescribed by physicians, but ~53% of rural counties in the US do not have a physician with the waiver or willingness to prescribe it.
*   **Privacy:** In small towns, social stigma is a barrier where residents often avoid local clinics.
*   **Insurance:** Prior authorization delays can take days, during whichtime a patient in withdrawal could replase or overdose.

### 9. How often do patients return to rehab and when they do, do they pick the same center?
*   **Relapse rate:** 40-60% of patients relapse within a year of treatment.
*   **Frequent flyers:** For state-funded systems, 45% of admissions are people who have been to rehab 1-4 times before. Another 13% have been 5+ times.
*   **30-day readmission zone:** Highest risk for readmission is in the first 30 days post-discharge.
*   **Private:** Patients often "rehab shop," trying different facilities under the belief that the previous center failed them. They also may change centers based on changes to their private insurance plan.
*   **Public:** Patients often return to the same facility out of necessity.
*   **Exceptions, where patients stay loyal:** Some centers invest heavily in alumni programs (reunions, Zoom calls, apps). If a patient feels a strong bond with staff or others, they are more likely to call that center for a brief stay.

### 10. Tell me about the marketing strategies for private centers, both how they are effective and how they are detrimental when it comes to helping patients choose a treatment center.
*   **Negative tactics:** By generic domains and spent dollars on Ads to appear at the top of Search results, then the call center responds but is biased referral service that are owned by large treatment chains or are paid to sell leads to the highest bidding facility. Other sites emphasize amentiies over medicine, which may trick families into equating comfort with clinical quality. Marketers can also infiltrate AA meetings, sober living homes, or online forums then offer incentives (even cash) to atttract patients. The center then pays the marketer a kickback fee for admission.
