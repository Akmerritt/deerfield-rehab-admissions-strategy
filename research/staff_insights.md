Use Microsoft teams and outlook to coordinate with the treatment team.
*   **General statistics:** Handful ~24 patient inquiries per day. Team size varies depending on the specific locaiton and overall volume of calls and assessments. A few admissions per day.
*   **Summary:** Key areas for improvement, ranked from most important, are (1) staff availability, having a well-trained and adequately staffed team (2) insurance verification, although having more experienced staff could help streamline this process (3) resource limitations, again addressing staff avaiablility could improve efficiency of discharge planning and coordination. Other areas for opportunity to explore include: improving the patient experience, building strong relationships with referral sources like hospitals / clinics / community organizations, leveraging technology more effectively (using data analytics to predict trends or patient needs), program diversification (specialized programs for different demographics), and staff well-being (ensuring staff are supported and have opportunities for professional developemtn).

About 30% of staff are proficient with both systems (usually more experienced). 50% are moderately proficient, can handle day-to-day but need help with more complex isses. Remaining 20% are getting up to speeddue to high turnover or new hires. These two systems are integrated. Rely on manual updates and specfici processes (spreadsheets, PDFs) for insurance information, financial records, and treatment-specific documentation - this accounts for about 20-30% of the work.

*   **Pain points 1 and 2 (staff):** High turnover and lengthy onboarding process
    *   **Potential solutions:** (1) Make tech more intuitive and user-friendly to reduce the learning curve for new staff and improve efficiency, e.g. simplify navigation and reduce the nmber of steps for common tasks, customize dashboards to show the most relevant information. (2) More targeted training sessions, e.g. go beyond the online tutorials / documentation / some hands-on practice that is quite generic, and implement more role-specific, scenario-based sessions that mimic real-life situations plus incorporate ineractive elements like live demonstrations and Q&A sesssions.

*   **Pain point 3 (tech):** Scattered tools.
    *   **Potential solutions:** Could also improve integration by automating the transfer of information from spreadsheets and PDFs into Salesforce. This could save time and ensure all relevant data is centralized, easily accessible, and accurate. Explore API connections between Salesforce, Five9, and other systems as well as looking into middleware solutions to act as a bridge between different systems, lastly coudl work with vendors to customize tailored solutions and conduct regular audits ofprocesses to identify specific areas where atomation could have the most significant impact.
 
*   **Pain point 5 (patient intake):** Insurance verification and pre-authorization.
    *   **Potential solutions:** Implement automation tools for initial insurance checks to pull and verify patient insurance details.
