# Ranked Pain Points: Admissions & Operations
*A prioritized analysis of the bottlenecks driving the 24-month decline in patient call volume.*

## Context
Based on research into the 11-center portfolio, the primary driver of declining admissions is an upper-funnel channel problem. We are over-reliant on stagnant ER referrals and are failing to capture growing demand from clinical partners (PCPs/Therapists).

## Ranked Pain Points (P0 = Highest Priority)

| Priority | Category | Pain Point | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Demand Gen | **Inadequate Channel Diversification** | **Critical:** Over-reliance on ERs. BDOs currently capture only 60% of clinical leads against a 75% target. |
| **P1** | Personnel | **Staffing Instability** | **High:** High turnover and 3-month onboarding times in the Mission Center (MC) disrupt referral relationships and intake accuracy. |
| **P2** | Operations | **Data Fragmentation** | **Med:** Manual use of PDFs/Excel outside of Salesforce/Five9 leads to miscommunication and delayed handoffs. |
| **P3** | Operations | **Insurance Verification (VOB) Latency** | **High:** 24–48 hour wait times cause high-intent clinical leads to drop off or call competitors. |
| **P4** | Operations | **Ineffective Resource Allocation** | **Low:** Avoidable spikes in call wait times during peak hours. |

## Focus Area
I am prioritizing the CareBridge Clinical Referral Platform as the primary "Proof of Concept" for the Board based on the following strategic logic:

1. **Direct Volume Impact (P0):** The primary crisis identified by the CEO and Sarah Chen is a 24-month decline in call volume (Upper Funnel). While staffing instability (P1) is a long-term risk, our current data shows that conversion rates have not yet dropped due to staffing inefficiencies. This indicates the "middle funnel" is still holding, and our immediate focus must be on generating new, high-intent demand.

2. **Leveraging Existing Initiatives:** A mentorship pilot is already underway at the centers. Rather than introducing a duplicative personnel program, CareBridge offers a new, tech-enabled growth lever that the portfolio currently lacks.

3. **Efficiency as a Retention Tool:** CareBridge addresses P1 (Staffing) indirectly by automating the most tedious parts of the intake process (Insurance OCR and data entry). By reducing the "tool fatigue" and administrative burden on the Mission Center, we improve staff morale and reduce the burnout that leads to turnover.

4. **Measurable 90-Day ROI:** CareBridge can be deployed as a "Thin Client" in 30 days, providing the Board with a measurable lift in admissions volume within a single quarter—something that a long-term cultural shift in staffing cannot provide.

To address the CEO's growth targets, we are focusing on **P0** and **P1**. Increasing clinical referral volume is the most scalable path to ROI, but success is contingent on stabilizing the Mission Center staff to handle the increased throughput.
