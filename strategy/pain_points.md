# Ranked Pain Points: Admissions & Operations
*A prioritized analysis of the bottlenecks driving the 24-month decline in patient call volume.*

## Context
Based on research into the 11-center portfolio, the primary driver of declining admissions is an upper-funnel channel problem. We are over-reliant on stagnant ER referrals and are failing to capture growing demand from clinical partners (PCPs/Therapists).

## Ranked Pain Points (P0 = Highest Priority)

| Priority | Category | Pain Point | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Demand Gen | **Inadequate Channel Diversification** | **Critical:** Over-reliance on ERs. BDOs currently capture only 60% of clinical leads against a 75% target. |
| **P1** | Personnel | **Staffing Instability** | **High:** High turnover and 3-month onboarding times in the Mission Center (MC) disrupt referral relationships and intake accuracy. |
| **P2** | Operations | **Data Fragmentation** | **Med:** Manual use of PDFs/Excel outside of Salesforce/Five9 leads to miscommunication and delayed handoffs. |
| **P3** | Operations | **Insurance Verification (VOB) Latency** | **High:** 24–48 hour wait times cause high-intent clinical leads to drop off or call competitors. |
| **P4** | Operations | **Ineffective Resource Allocation** | **Low:** Avoidable spikes in call wait times during peak hours. |

## Focus Area for Board Pitch
To address the CEO's growth targets, we are focusing on **P0** and **P1**. Increasing clinical referral volume is the most scalable path to ROI, but success is contingent on stabilizing the Mission Center staff to handle the increased throughput.
