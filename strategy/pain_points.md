# Ranked Pain Points: Admissions & Operations
*A prioritized analysis of the pain points driving the decline in call volume and low admission volume.*

## Context
Based on research into the 11-center portfolio, the primary driver of declining admissions is an upper-funnel channel problem. We are over-reliant on stagnant ER referrals and are failing to capture growing demand from clinical partners (PCPs/Therapists).

## Ranked Pain Points (P0 = Highest Priority)

| Priority | Category | Pain Point | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | Demand Gen | **Inadequate Channel Diversification** | **Critical:** Over-reliance on ERs. BDOs currently capture only 60% of clinical leads against a 75% target. |
| **P1** | Personnel | **Staffing Instability** | **High:** High turnover and 3-month onboarding times in the Mission Center (MC) disrupt referral relationships and intake accuracy. |
| **P2** | Operations | **Data Fragmentation** | **Med:** Manual use of PDFs/Excel outside of Salesforce/Five9 leads to miscommunication and delayed handoffs. |
| **P3** | Operations | **Insurance Verification (VOB) Latency** | **Med:** 24–48 hour wait times cause high-intent clinical leads to drop off or call competitors. |
| **P4** | Operations | **Lack of homecare services** | **Med:** As patient demand for these services grows, this will be an important offering to remain competitive in the market. |

## Focus Area

To meet the growth targets, we are focusing on **P0** and **P1**. Increasing clinical referral volume is the most scalable path to ROI, but success is contingent on stabilizing the Mission Center staff to handle the increased throughput.

Although **P2** and **P3** are important, conversion rates have remained steady at 10-15% and above industry standards of 8-12% indicating there is not an immediate issue in the middle ofthe funnel.

**P4** is high risk / high reward, and will need to be piloted to better understand impact before further investment. This can be done as a follow-on effort if there is product-market fit and sufficient growth opportunity, using CareBridge as a platform to coordinate home care services.
