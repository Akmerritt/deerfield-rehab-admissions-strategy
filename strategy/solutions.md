# Strategic Solutions: Growth & Operations
*Tiered solutions designed to scale admissions volume and stabilize internal infrastructure.*

## 1. Channel Diversification (Addressing P0)

### **CareBridge: Clinical Referral Portal**
A lightweight, HIPAA-compliant interface for PCPs and therapists to refer patients and follow them through the end-to-end journey across intake, admissions, treatment, and discharge.
*   **Impact:** Provides low barriers for referral, real-time bed availability, a communication channel with BDO and MC staff, as well as a feedback channel and a metrics dashboard so that clinicians can build relationships with the treatment center and improve patient outcomes over time.

### **CME Knowledge Hub**
A structured, CME-accredited educational series for local clinicians focusing on MAT (Medication-Assisted Treatment) induction and early intervention (SBIRT).
*   **Impact:** Builds trust and relationships with PCPs by providing them with clinical value beyond bed placement.

### **Automated Feedback Loop**
An automated system that pushes recovery milestones and discharge summaries back to the referring clinician.
*   **Impact:** Demonstrates treatment efficacy and closes the care cycle, incentivizing repeat referrals.

## 2. Staffing Stability (Addressing P1)

### **Scenario-Based Onboarding**
Modernizing the MC training from generic tutorials to interactive, role-specific simulations.
*   **Impact:** Reduces "competency ramp-up" time from 3-6 months to ~weeks.

### **Lead-Mentor Program**
A 90-day structured mentorship where veteran staff guide new hires, incentivized by "Lead" titles and stipends.
*   **Impact:** Preserves institutional knowledge and creates a visible career path to reduce turnover.
