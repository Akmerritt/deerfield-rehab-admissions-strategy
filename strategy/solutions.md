# Solution Ideas: Growth & Operations
*Tiered solutions designed to scale admissions volume and stabilize internal infrastructure.*

## 1. Channel Diversification (Addressing P0)

### **CareBridge: Clinical Referral Portal**
A lightweight, HIPAA-compliant interface for PCPs and therapists to refer patients and follow them through the end-to-end journey across intake, admissions, treatment, and discharge.
*   **Impact:** Provides low barriers for referral, real-time bed availability, a communication channel with BDO and MC staff, as well as a feedback channel and a metrics dashboard so that clinicians can build relationships with the treatment center and improve patient outcomes over time.

### **CME Knowledge Hub**
A structured, CME-accredited educational series for local clinicians focusing on MAT (Medication-Assisted Treatment) induction and early intervention (SBIRT).
*   **Impact:** Builds trust and relationships with PCPs by providing them with clinical value beyond bed placement.

### **Automated Feedback Loop**
An automated system that pushes recovery milestones and discharge summaries back to the referring clinician.
*   **Impact:** Demonstrates treatment efficacy and closes the care cycle, incentivizing repeat referrals.

## 2. Staffing Stability (Addressing P1)

### **Scenario-Based Onboarding**
Modernizing the MC training from generic tutorials to interactive, role-specific simulations.
*   **Impact:** Reduces "competency ramp-up" time from 3-6 months to ~weeks.

### **Lead-Mentor Program**
A 90-day structured mentorship where veteran staff guide new hires, incentivized by "Lead" titles and stipends.
*   **Impact:** Preserves institutional knowledge and creates a visible career path to reduce turnover.

I am prioritizing the CareBridge Clinical Referral Platform as the primary "Proof of Concept" for the Board based on the following rationale:

1. **Direct Volume Impact (P0):** The primary crisis identified by the CEO and Sarah Chen is a 24-month decline in call volume (Upper Funnel). While staffing instability (P1) is a long-term risk, our current data shows that conversion rates have not yet dropped due to staffing inefficiencies. This indicates the "middle funnel" is still holding, and our immediate focus must be on generating new, high-intent demand.

2. **Leveraging Existing Initiatives:** A mentorship pilot is already underway at the centers. Rather than introducing a duplicative personnel program, CareBridge offers a new, tech-enabled growth lever that the portfolio currently lacks.

3. **Efficiency as a Retention Tool:** CareBridge addresses P1 (Staffing) indirectly by automating the most tedious parts of the intake process (Insurance OCR and data entry). By reducing the "tool fatigue" and administrative burden on the Mission Center, we improve staff morale and reduce the burnout that leads to turnover.

4. **Measurable 90-Day ROI:** CareBridge can be deployed as a "Thin Client" in 30 days, providing the Board with a measurable lift in admissions volume within a single quarter—something that a long-term cultural shift in staffing cannot provide.
